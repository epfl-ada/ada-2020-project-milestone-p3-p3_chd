# P3 milestone

## Title
Test and verify the first 4 propositions on an one-month reddit comments dataset. 

## Abstract

In the paper, 10 propositions were tested on a representative twitter user dataset. And some of the results are not consistent with the previous study. We propose to use a different dataset to test again a part of these propositions. Reddit is another popular social new and discussion website. More precisely, the propositions that we decide to test is:
+ 20%-80% rule of content generation.
+ Originality, sociability, and syntactic use.
+ Circadian rhythms.
+ Attention and productivity.(but this also have follower-followee issue......)

Some certain propositions cannot be properly tested because reddit doesn't have a follower-followee system.
